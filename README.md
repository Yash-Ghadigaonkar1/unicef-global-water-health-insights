# UNICEF Global Water & Health Insights

This project explores the intersection of water access and youth health using UNICEF datasets. It is developed as part of a Dublin City University data analysis assignment focused on storytelling with data, leveraging Python, Polars, Quarto, Google Colab and Plotnine.

## Project Summary

**Title:** *Pipes, Pounds & Progress: A Global Look at Water Access and Youth Health*  
**Objective:** Analyze and visualize how piped water access correlates with public health indicators in youth populations globally.
